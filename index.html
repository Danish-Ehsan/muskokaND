			<h2>My Practice</h2>

			<h2>My Credentials</h2>
			<ul id="credentialsItems">
				<li>I have carefully studied the science, diagnosis, philosophy, and history of medical systems to find natural solutions that work. I believe that natural solutions need not be slow, bad tasting, or expensive. I don’t believe that evidence based medicine needs to be at odds with traditional or more esoteric approaches. My art is to find pleasurable, sustainable, and simple solutions that get you results.</li>

			<h2>about ND<span>s</span></h2>
			<p>Naturopathic Doctors, or NDs, employ a unique and comprehensive approach to improving health and treating illness.<br><br>The primary goal of treatment is to address the cause of the problem. That means seeing the patient as a whole person, and considering the following factors when diagnosing and developing treatment:</p>

			<h2>Life Itself</h2>
			<p>When I’m not hard at work healing, I volunteer for the Town of Bracebridge Parks and Trails and Recreation Committee, as well as the Muskoka Trail Council. We work with local politicians and health officials on issues surrounding active transportation, eliminating pesticide / herbicide use, trail upkeep, and other initiatives geared towards helping Muskoka and its people.<br><br>I regularly hold seminars for indigenous people in Rama, helping them improve their health and diets. I also travel frequently to men’s prisons, teaching inmates about the positive effects of nutrition and naturopathy. And finally, I can be found at home with my wife Allyson, and my two wonderful kids Seamus and Bronwyn – all of whom can be found on my Instagram account. Speaking of which…</p>
