		<h2>My Practice</h2>

			<li>I have carefully studied the science, diagnosis, philosophy, and history of medical systems to find natural solutions that work. I believe that natural solutions need not be slow, bad tasting, or expensive. I don’t believe that evidence based medicine needs to be at odds with traditional or more esoteric approaches. My art is to find pleasurable, sustainable, and simple solutions that get you results.</li>
