		<h2>here's what I believe</h2>

		<ol id="beliefsList">
			<li>Do no harm.</li>
			<li>Boost the body's ability to heal itself.</li>
			<li>Treat the cause, not the symptoms.</li>
			<li>Treat the whole person, not their separate parts.</li>
			<li>The Doctor is a teacher</li>
			<li>Prevention is the best technique</li>
		</ol>

		<p>These are the central tenets of naturopath - and I've adhered to them ever since I put my passion into practice, over 15 years ago.</p>
